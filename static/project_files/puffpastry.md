# puffpastry
## Summer 2023

puffpastry is a machine learning framework that I wrote from scratch in pure rust using as few crates as I could.
It mimics the style of the popular python library keras. My motivation for creating this project was simply to explore
the Rust trait system and make my knowledge about machine learning more concrete. 

By doing so, I encountered many issues that I otherwise would never have thought about: preventing values from exploding by using effective weight
initialization, handling N-dimensional structures in a static langauge, writing a backpropogation algorithm that works
with multiple types of layers, and more like these.
