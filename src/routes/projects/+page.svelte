        puffpastry is a machine learning framework that I wrote from scratch in
        pure rust using as few crates as I could. It mimics the style of the
        popular python library keras.

        My motivation for creating this project was simply to explore Rust's
        trait system and make my knowledge about machine learning more concrete.
        By doing so, I encountered many issues that I otherwise would never have
        thought about: preventing values from exploding by using effective
        weight initialization, handling N-dimensional structures in a static
        langauge, writing a backpropogation algorithm that works with multiple
        types of layers, and more like these.
