# twitch chat clone
## Summer 2023

I was interested in Rust and wanted to learn how to work without the backend library, Axum.
At the same time, I also wanted to learn about frontend development, specifically SvelteKit.
I combined both these interests into a single project, a copy of the Twitch chat.

I learned about WebSockets and other forms of client-server communication methods like
SSE (Server Side Events). I also learned about multithreaded data handling by exploring
structures like Mutex(es?) and tokio.
